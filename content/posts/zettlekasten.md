This is a note-taking system created by Niklas Luhmann, in which all your notes are inter-connected.

Each note focuses on a specific subject, written in your own words. This is crucial, you have to take the time to understand it in order to record it.

These notes should be used to explain concepts or ideas. Not an area for journaling.
